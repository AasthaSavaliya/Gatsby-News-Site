Using the tool, you can track the planet’s vital signs – everything from carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide to sea level and soil moisture levels – as well as follow the fleet of Earth satellites providing those measurements.\n\nEyes on the Earth offers an engaging, interactive resource to learn more about environmental phenomena and their impacts.\n\nFor instance, to see measurements of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in a particular part of the globe, navigate to the Vital Signs menu and click the carbon dioxide button. Eyes on the Earth will show a visualization of data from NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite, which measures the gas from the ground to the top of the atmosphere. (To ensure the greatest accuracy, the mission reprocesses the data in the months prior to it appearing in Eyes.) Click “animate data,” specify a date range and see how levels shift over time."},"thumbnail":[{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/i5po4o4kx8m5/6XWJAnt9dydzjZ9LM7TTnp/3584c6c859e64343c4b022e40d9a0c36/nasa.gif"},"title":"nasa"}]}},{"node":{"slug":"The cutting-edge Earth science satellites launching in the next couple of years will give more detailed views of our planet than ever before.

We’ll be able to track small-scale ocean features like coastal currents that move nutrients vital to marine food webs, monitor how much fresh water flows through lakes and rivers, and spot movement in Earth’s surface of less than half an inch (a centimeter). But these satellites will also produce a deluge of data that has engineers and scientists setting up systems in the cloud capable of processing, storing, and analyzing all of that digital information.\n\n“About five or six years ago, there was a realization that future Earth missions were going to be generating a huge volume of data and that the systems we were using would become inadequate very quickly,” said Suresh Vannan, manager of the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.\n\nThe center is one of several under NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems program responsible for processing, archiving, documenting, and distributing data from the agency’s Earth-observing satellites and field projects. The program has been working for several years on a solution to the information-volume challenge by moving its data and data-handling systems from local servers to the cloud – software and computing services that run on the internet instead of locally on someone’s machine."},"thumbnail":[{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/i5po4o4kx8m5/6jAegKLPbm352jhffoUznh/e73b4065f022e8958a0a132fa377c1f1/nasa1.jpeg"},"title":"nasa1"}]}},{"node":{"slug":"NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy affirmed the agency’s commitment to studying climate change during a visit to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California on Oct. 14.","title":"NASA Leadership Visits JPL, Discusses Climate Change and Mars","content":{"content":"NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy affirmed the agency’s commitment to studying climate change during a visit to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California on Oct. 14.

I can’t stop watching.\n\nMr. Beast first gained viral notoriety by gaming whatever the YouTube algorithm was at the time – one of his big early successes was a daylong video where he counted to 100,000 – then pivoted into what I can only describe as ‘stunt philanthropy’, i.e. giving a homeless person $10,000 and watching them sob gratefully on camera, or treating a family to a Christmas-saving no-limits trip around Best Buy. Obviously, I cannot criticise the guy giving away money to the needy, no matter how mawkish and calculated I find it, so you see how Mr. Beast has me in an absolute headlock.\n\nThis week, Mr. Beast – one of the few YouTubers, like Mark Rober, who are such enormous stars in their own right that they can drop videos as and when they please, rather than having to rustle up content to feed the algorithmic beast every one or two days – launched his much-trailed version of Netflix’s Squid Game, where he … well, he just did Squid Game."},"thumbnail":[{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/i5po4o4kx8m5/4LPSfvrfvwrtloiBvcbfQU/ea29bebb938970903b67e725c99aa0c5/sg.jpg"},"title":"sg"}]}}]}}}
